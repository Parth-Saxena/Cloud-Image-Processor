# Cloud-Image-Processor

Project Overview
This project implements a scalable cloud-based image processing pipeline utilizing AWS services. The solution leverages AWS S3 for storage and AWS Lambda for executing image processing tasks in a serverless environment. The goal is to provide an efficient, cost-effective method for processing images on the cloud without the need to manage server infrastructure.

Features
Image Upload and Storage: Securely upload and store images in an AWS S3 bucket.

Serverless Processing: Automatically trigger AWS Lambda functions upon image upload to perform various processing tasks such as resizing, filtering, and format conversion.

Scalability: The serverless architecture ensures automatic scaling to handle varying loads.

Cost Efficiency: AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing model optimizes costs based on actual usage.

Technologies Used
AWS S3: For storing original and processed images.

AWS Lambda: For serverless execution of image processing tasks.

AWS CloudWatch: For monitoring and logging.

Python: Primary language for Lambda functions.

Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
An AWS account with necessary permissions.

Python environment set up locally.

AWS CLI configured.

Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-image-processor.git
cd cloud-image-processor
Install required dependencies:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
Deployment
Set up AWS S3 bucket:

Create an S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.

Update the bucket name in the Lambda function configuration.

Deploy Lambda functions:

Use AWS SAM or the AWS Management Console to deploy the Lambda functions.

Usage
Upload an image:

Upload an image to the S3 bucket via the AWS Management Console or programmatically.

Trigger processing:

The Lambda function is automatically triggered upon image upload and performs the designated processing tasks.
